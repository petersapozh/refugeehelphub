                        <h2>Different ways to get access to English Classes in the UK as a refugee</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Methods</p>
                        <li class="help-list">LOCAL COUNCIL: This may be your most viable option when it comes to getting English classes. This is because your local council will have a provision for English classes. This should be free so try as hard as you can to avoid paying for these classes as the councils have an obligation to provide these for free. The only problem with this is that they will, in general, be held during the daytime so you cannot attend these if you have work.</li>
                        <li class="help-list">STEP UKRAINE: The World Jewish Relief Council and the British Council is currently running this program. This not only will help you with learning the language but also with getting employment. It consists of "An intensive 10 weeks of 2.5 hour daily English classes by the British Council, with options to take the lessons morning, afternoon or evening" and "12 weeks of weekly employment support with a dedicated employment advisor, to support with: CV writing, job applications, interview prep, support with job search, and specialist workshops" and "All classes are remote, and teacher led. They are streamed so you will be with classmates at a similar level." Overall this is a fantastic program to help you to settle into the United Kingdom, learn the language and find employment. To apply go to the World Jewish Relief website and submit an application through thier page.</li>
                        <li class="help list">OTHER OPTIONS: If for whatever reason these are not viable for you, there are also other options that you can take. These are classes at local further education centres, classes at local libraries, lessons online and more. More information on these options will be added to the website by the end of Decemeber. </li>
