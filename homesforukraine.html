                        <h2>Pros and Cons of Homes For Ukraine Scheme.</h2>
                        <p>What does 'Homes for Ukraine' scheme do?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The scheme enables people to host Ukrainian nationals. You can be granted a visa for up to 3 years and the host must sponsor you for a minimum of 6 months. For the first 12 months the host will be afforded £350 per month, the next 12 months after that £500 pounds will be given. This money will be guaranteed to be spent on the needs of you, the Ukrainian refugees.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">Pros</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is well funded and well run. It has received a total of £2.1 billion since its beginning, with £650 million being announced in funding at the end of December 2022. This means that hopefully Ukranians under this scheme that are moving into new communities  can receive the care they need as this money will go to local authorities.</li>
                            <li>It is relatively quick and most applications get processed. Up to July of 2023 77% of all application visas were processed within 15 days which shows a certain level of reliability.
                                Furthermore, it is relatively certain that the scheme will not be going anywhere anytime soon and will be running for at least the next three years.
                                </li>
                            <li>
                                There is a large supply of sponsors. In fact as of august 2023 there have been nearly 250,000 people who have expressed interest in acting as a sponsor under the scheme. This means that you are likely to find a sponsor if you apply under this scheme.
                                </li>

                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">cons</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As with any housing sponsorship scheme safeguarding and housing will always be an issue. In schemes such as ‘Homes for Ukraine’ there is always a chance of exploitation. Furthermore, there runs a risk of homelessness. In fact, in an investigation into the scheme done by the National Audit Organisation (NAO) they found that nearly 5000 households under the scheme were at risk of homelessness between the months of March 2022 and August 2023. </li>

                        <h2>overview</h2>
                        <p>Overall, this is an excellent scheme to apply for in the United Kingdom if you do not have any family members that live here. You are relatively likely to be granted a visa and the scheme is  well funded and efficient. However, with schemes like these there is a risk when it comes to safeguarding, exploitation and homelessness and Ukranians under the scheme are especially susceptible to these dangers.</p>
