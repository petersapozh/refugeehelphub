                        <h2>Pros and Cons of Ukraine Family Scheme.</h2>
                        <p>What does 'Ukraine Family Scheme' scheme do?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It allows you to go to the United kingdom to join family members that are currently residing there. However, unlike other schemes the whole family has to submit separate applications. This is different from the Homes for Ukraine scheme in the sense that there are eligibility rules. These are: You must be joining a family-member living in the UK; You must be Ukrainian or Family member of a Ukrainian person applying; You have to have been living in Ukraine before 1 January 2022.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">Pros</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is virtually inaccessible to you if you do not have a family member in the UK. This means that you will have to apply using the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme which would mean a potentially longer review process and a lesser chance of being granted a visa.
                            </li>
                     

                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">cons</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As with any housing sponsorship scheme safeguarding and housing will always be an issue. In schemes such as ‘Homes for Ukraine’ there is always a chance of exploitation. Furthermore, there runs a risk of homelessness. In fact, in an investigation into the scheme done by the National Audit Organisation (NAO) they found that nearly 5000 households under the scheme were at risk of homelessness between the months of March 2022 and August 2023. </li>

                        <h2>overview</h2>
                        <p>Overall, this is an excellent scheme to apply for in the United Kingdom if you do not have any family members that live here. You are relatively likely to be granted a visa and the scheme is  well funded and efficient. However, with schemes like these there is a risk when it comes to safeguarding, exploitation and homelessness and Ukranians under the scheme are especially susceptible to these dangers.</p>
