                        <ul>
                            <li class="help-list">One of the things that you will need to do once you arrive in the UK is find a job. This is important for several reasons. Firstly it is important to receive a steady income to support yourself financially. Although it is possible you will be receiving money from the government sponsorship schemes it may not be enough to get by. Furthermore, it is very likely that at some point during your stay in the United Kingdom you will need to rent a place to live. This will be much easier to pass the requirements for renting accommodation. You can begin your search for a job on job-boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, or Totaljobs.</li>
                            <li class="help-list">An important thing to mention is the legal requirements. You can legally begin work straight away upon your entry to the UKif you received your visa  under any of the sponsorship schemes (Homes for Ukraine, Family scheme, Extension scheme.) meaning you do not require a biometric residence permit however it would be useful to get one within your first 6 months in the UK as some employers incorrectly assume you need one to be employed in the UK.
                            </li>
                            <li class="help-list">Normally your first order of business would be to create a resume which demonstrates your skills and positive qualities. You can look up examples of resumes on the internet and you will find some excellent guides on what to do.</li>
                            <li class="help-list"> You can also make an account on platforms like Linkedin which will allow you to network and find jobs through that platform. One thing that a lot of employers are looking for is a good level of English. If you want to find a guide on how to improve your English as a refugee check on the gov.uk website</li>
