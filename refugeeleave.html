                        <h2>General Process of applying for asylum in the United Kingdom</h2>
                        <p class="lead">placeholder</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="help-list">When you arrive in the UK you must quickly submit an application by calling the home office (0300 123 4193). They will ask questions and send you an address where you must send a letter regarding a screening appointment. If destitute or homeless you can go straight to the screening unit (Lunar House, 40 Wellesley Road, Croydon CR9 2BY)</li>
                            <li class="help-list"> Next is the screening interview with the home office where you will be asked about why you are seeking asylum. Fingerprints and photos will be taken. This interview is with an immigration officer</li>
                            <li class="help-list">After the screening interview you will have an asylum interview. The interviewer will ask about your situation and what you fear in your country of origin. They will ask you if you want to hand in evidence as they will be interviewing you about your claim to asylum. This interview is with a caseworker and you will get the decision within 6 months after the interview</li>
                            <li class="help-list">For evidence you must write a personal witness statement in which you describe why you cannot safely remain in your previous country. You should include a description of your family education and employment that you have had. To conclude it you must describe why you are scared to go back and why you decided to leave your country. You may also include letters of support or witness statements from friends and family  and medical records if necessary (say for example you endured an injury). Information on your country can also be included to provide evidence for why you cannot stay there.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">The possible outcomes</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="help-list">You can be granted refugee status for 5 years. You get the same benefits as a UK citizen. At the end you can apply for indefinite leave or remain if still at risk in your country.</li>
                            <li class="help-list">Granted refugee status for 2.5 years. If the home office decided that you did not claim asylum (as in submit your application) as soon as you should have, or if on your journey to the UK you stopped off in another country where the home office thinks you could have claimed asylum you will be placed in ‘group 2’. At the end you can apply for another 2.5 years of asylum and after 10 you can apply for indefinite leave</li>
                            <li class="help-list">Humanitarian protection. If you are not fleeing for reasons of individual persecution but rather if you are fleeing war or violence then it is possible that you will not qualify for refugee status. Instead you could be granted humanitarian protection. This brings almost all of the same rights as ‘a’ (refugee status for 5 years). For this you will need to use your national passport. Else you will need proof that you cannot provide that document and then apply for a certificate of travel also called home office travel document.  This will provide you similar benefits to refugee status.</li>

                        <p class="lead">The Different Schemes</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="help-list">HOMES FOR UKRAINE SCHEME: The scheme enables people to host Ukrainian nationals. You can be granted a visa for up to 3 years and the host must sponsor you for a minimum of 6 months. For the first 12 months the host will be afforded £350 per month, the next 12 months after that £500 pounds will be given. This money will be guaranteed to be spent on the needs of you, the Ukrainian refugees.
                            </li>
                            <li class="help-list">UKRAINE FAMILY SCHEME: It allows you to go to the United kingdom to join family members that are currently residing there. However, unlike other schemes the whole family has to submit separate applications. This is different from the Homes for Ukraine scheme in the sense that there are eligibility rules. These are: You must be joining a family-member living in the UK; You must be Ukrainian or Family member of a Ukrainian person applying; You have to have been living in Ukraine before 1 January 2022.
                            </li>

                        <li class="help-list"> UKRAINE EXTENSION SCHEME: With the Ukraine Extension Scheme you are allowed to apply if you had permission to be in the United Kingdom between the dates of 18 March 2022 and 16 November 2023 OR if you had permission to be in the United Kingdom before the date of 1 January 2022 (even if it is expired).</li>
