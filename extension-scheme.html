                        <h2>Pros and Cons of Ukraine Extension Scheme.</h2>
                        <p>What does 'Ukraine Extension Scheme' scheme do?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>With the Ukraine Extension Scheme you are allowed to apply if you had permission to be in the United Kingdom between the dates of 18 March 2022 and 16 November 2023 OR if you had permission to be in the United Kingdom before the date of 1 January 2022 (even if it is expired).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">Pros</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Much like the Ukraine Family Scheme this is aimed at more specific sector of Ukrainian refugees. Due to this the process may be quicker than the Homes for Ukraine scheme and if you fall in one of the eligibility categories it is much more likely that you will be granted a visa.
                            </li>
                     

                        </ul>
                        <p class="lead">cons</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The main disadvantage of this is that the majority of Ukrainian refugees cannot apply for this scheme as it is made specifically for those with worker or student visas in the United Kingdom. Which means if you do not meet the eligibility criteria you will have to apply through the Homes for Ukraine scheme which takes a longer time and has a lower rate of granting visas as there are many more applicants.
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                    <div class="col-lg-8">
                        <h2>overview</h2>
                        <p>Overall, it must be said that this is the scheme that you should apply through if you meet the eligibility criteria as you will find that the review process will be quicker and you will have a much higher chance of being accepted. However, unfortunately this scheme may be inaccessible to you if you do not fall under the conditions needed to apply. To conclude, this is an excellent scheme for those that had permission to be in the United Kingdom in the given dates.</p>
